          Have done tables with dynamic columns (accounts and payment history in Emerge), have done dynamic popups, I have a demo of Angular directives and a good template from John Papa. I have learned to use filters, including a filter that uses the dynamic name of another filter. It might help to go back to old branches and copy some of the code I created there. I have wanted to create directives that can act as web components. I have wanted to understand more about the compiling and linking phase, but mostly to build and create and have a good demo of my skills.  This will help my career more. Depth of knowledge is important, but building is more important, and getting experience. This is what a senior dev has - great ability to solve problems and create, especially to architect. I want to be an expert at MEAN stack, and somewhat at Rails. John has said that taking leadership on a big project is the best way, like Court Times. The long term Plan B is C# .net, if the market does not grow suffiently in what I am doing now.  Efficiency of my study and projects is becoming very important, to make the progress I need to senior dev. 
          Do development like I do music
          I like having nice things, a nice place, and doing fun
          adventures with people.
